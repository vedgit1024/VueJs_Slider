### Visual Hierarchy and Web Design Principles

#A visual hierarchy is maintained and web design principles like topography, fonts, colors, whitespaces and website personality are kept in mind.
#Google font ("Inter") is used as it was the most suitable font I found.
#Prime Focus is on the main content that is the movie card. 
#Proper greenish shadow, higher opacity along with scaling of movie card on hovering it, gains all attention of the user.
#Visual Hierarchy is ensured good for better user experience.
#Each movie card has proper gap in between them for better clarity and space.
